#### Django full_stack Web Application

This web application was developed as part of the postgraduate course: ***"Distributed and Parallel Operating Systems"*** in order to understand the Model-View-Control architecture. 
* The framework selected was *Django* due to the upcoming popularity of Python programming language. 
* A full-stack application was developed regarding sensor measurements for Data and Crowd Analytics.
* As for the front-end part of our application, a bootstrap template and simple JS code was used aiming to improve the overall user experience (facilitate future visualization, dump of the database etc.) .

* It was developed in Ubuntu 16.04.LTS, Django version 1.11 and hosted freely online.
